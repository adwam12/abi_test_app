# App for Abi

Hi Abi! This project is a simple full-stack app that shows the basic on how to build a Node.js backend using Express and TypeScript and a React frontend built with Vite (Vite is a frontend dev build and bundling tool. It's the industry standard).

I also added the command to run to run this app through docker

## Project Structure

Here's what the directory structure looks like:

```
abi_test_app/
├── Dockerfile
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.ts
├── src
│   └── app.ts
├── frontend
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── vite.config.ts
│   └── src
│       ├── App.tsx
│       └── main.tsx
├── dist (this gets generated by "tsc")
└── frontend/dist (generated by "vite build")
```

## Getting Started

- I made this to run with Node v20. If you have another one installed, you should download NVM (Node Version Manager). 

- You can do "node -v" to see what version you have. If its under 20.0:

You can use this curl command to download nvm:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

Then you can do:

```sh
nvm install v20
```

And finally:
```sh
nvm use v20
```

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 recommended)
- **NPM** (included with Node.js)
- **Docker Desktop** (for containerizing the app)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd abi_test_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

### Build the Backend

- Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command compiles the TypeScript files in `src/` into JavaScript and places them in the `dist/` folder.

- You don't have to build if you just want to run the app locally (not using Docker).

### Build the Frontend

- Run the following command to build the React app using Vite:

   ```sh
   npm run frontend
   ```

   The compiled files are placed in `frontend/dist/`.

- This step is optional if you are not using Docker. If running your app locally, you don't need to build the frontend.

### Running the Application Locally (Not Using Docker)

- Start the backend and serve the frontend:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This runs the compiled backend code from `dist/app.js` and serves the frontend from `frontend/dist/`.

### Running the Application with Docker

1. **Build the backend and frontend:**

   ```sh
   npm run build && npm run frontend
   ```

2. **Docker Commands:**

   - Build the Docker image:

     ```sh
     docker build -t abi_test_app .
     ```

   - Run the Docker container:

     ```sh
     docker run -p 3000:3000 -d abi_test_app
     ```

3. **Access the application:**

   - Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - You should also be able to see the container in Docker. Click 'See details' to view its logs.

## Project Overview

### Backend (Express + TypeScript)

- This is our server built using Express.
- TypeScript is used to add type safety and clarity to our code.
- The backend serves the React frontend and can be extended to include additional API endpoints.

### Frontend (React + Vite)

- The frontend is a React application.
- Vite is used as the build tool to bundle the app.
- In this project, you'll learn how React handles state, events, conditional rendering, and list rendering.

### Docker

- The `Dockerfile` packages both the backend and frontend into a single image.
- This allows you to run the entire application in a container, ensuring consistency across different environments.
